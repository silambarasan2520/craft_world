					Calligraphy (from Greek: καλλιγραφία) is a visual workmanship identified with composing. It is the plan and execution of lettering with an expansive tipped instrument, brush, or other composing instrument. A contemporary calligraphic practice can be characterized as "the craft of offering structure to signs in an expressive, agreeable, and capable manner".<br><br> 

Current calligraphy goes from utilitarian engravings and plans to artistic work pieces where the letters could conceivably be intelligible. Traditional calligraphy varies from typography and non-old style hand-lettering, however a calligrapher may rehearse both.<br><br> 

Calligraphy keeps on thriving in the types of wedding solicitations and occasion solicitations, textual style plan and typography, unique hand-lettered logo plan, strict workmanship, declarations, visual communication and appointed calligraphic craftsmanship, cut stone engravings, and commemoration reports.

					The chief apparatuses for a calligrapher are the pen and the brush. Calligraphy pens compose with nibs that might be level, round, or pointed. For some enlivening purposes, multi-nibbed pens—steel brushes—can be utilized. Notwithstanding, works have additionally been made with felt-tip and ballpoint pens, in spite of the fact that these works don't utilize calculated lines. There are a few styles of calligraphy, for example, Gothic content, that require a stub nib pen.<br><br> 

Composing ink is generally water-based and is substantially less thick than the oil-based inks utilized in printing. Certain strength paper with high ink retention and consistent surface empowers cleaner lines, in spite of the fact that material or vellum is regularly utilized, as a blade can be utilized to eradicate defects and a light-box isn't expected to permit lines to go through it. Regularly, light boxes and formats are utilized to accomplish straight lines without pencil markings degrading the work. Administered paper, either for a light box or direct use, is frequently managed each quarter or half inch, despite the fact that inch spaces are infrequently utilized. This is the situation with litterea unciales (thus the name), and school managed paper regularly goes about as a rule well.<br><br>

					In old China, the most established Chinese characters existing are Jiǎgǔwén characters (甲骨文) cut on bull scapulae and turtle plastrons, in light of the fact that the dominators in Shang Dynasty cut pits on such creatures' bones and afterward prepared them to pick up sponsorship of military undertakings, agrarian reap, or in any event, multiplying and climate. During the divination service, after the breaks were made, the characters were composed with a brush on the shell or issue that remains to be worked out later cut. (Keightley, 1978). With the improvement of Jīnwén (Bronzeware content) and Dàzhuàn (Large Seal Script) "cursive" signs proceeded. Mao Gong Ding is one of the most well known and regular Bronzeware contents in the Chinese calligraphy history. It has 500 characters on the bronze which is the biggest number of bronze engraving we have found up until this point. In addition, each bygone realm of current China had its own arrangement of characters.<br><br> 

In Imperial China, the charts on old steles—some dating from 200 BC, and in Xiaozhuan style—are still accessible.<br><br> 

Around 220 BC, the sovereign Qin Shi Huang, the first to vanquish the whole Chinese bowl, forced a few changes, among them Li Si's character unification, which made a bunch of 3300 normalized Xiǎozhuàn（小篆） characters. Regardless of the way that the primary composing execute of the time was at that point the brush, scarcely any papers get by from this period, and the fundamental instances of this style are on steles.<br><br> 

The Lìshū style (隸書/隸书)(clerical content) which is more regularized, and somehow or another like present day text, have been additionally approved under Qin Shi Huangdi.<br><br> 

Between administrative content and conventional customary content, there is another progress kind of calligraphy works called Wei Bei. It had begun at the South and North line and finished before Tang Dynasty.<br><br> 

Kǎishū style (customary ordinary content)— still being used today—and credited to Wang Xizhi (王羲之, 303–361) and his devotees, is significantly more regularized. Its spread was empowered by Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang (926–933), who requested the printing of the works of art utilizing new wooden squares in Kaishu. Printing advances here permitted a shape adjustment. The Kaishu state of characters 1000 years prior was generally like that toward the finish of Imperial China. In any case, little changes have been made, for instance looking like 广 which isn't totally the equivalent in the Kangxi Dictionary of 1716 as in present day books. The Kangxi and current shapes have minuscule contrasts, while stroke request is as yet the equivalent, as indicated by old style.<br><br> 

Styles which didn't endure incorporate Bāfēnshū, a blend made of Xiaozhuan style at 80%, and Lishu at 20%. Some variation Chinese characters were strange or privately utilized for quite a long time. They were commonly seen however consistently dismissed in authentic writings. A portion of these unconventional variations, notwithstanding some recently made characters, make the Simplified Chinese character set.
