					<b><h9>Origins:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					
					The process used to tailor, patch, mend and reinforce cloth fostered the development of sewing techniques, and the decorative possibilities of sewing led to the art of embroidery. Indeed, the remarkable stability of basic embroidery stitches has been noted.<br>

It is a striking fact that in the development of embroidery there are no changes of materials or techniques which can be felt or interpreted as advances from a primitive to a later, more refined stage. On the other hand, we often find in early works a technical accomplishment and high standard of craftsmanship rarely attained in later times.<br>

The art of embroidery has been found worldwide and several early examples have been found. Works in China have been dated to the Warring States period (5th–3rd century BC). In a garment from Migration period Sweden, roughly 300–700 AD, the edges of bands of trimming are reinforced with running stitch, back stitch, stem stitch, tailor's buttonhole stitch, and whip-stitching, but it is uncertain whether this work simply reinforced the seams or should be interpreted as decorative embroidery.<br>

Ancient Greek mythology has credited the goddess Athena with passing down the art of embroidery along with weaving, leading to the famed competition between herself and the mortal Arachne.
					
					</ul>
					<b><h9>Historical applications and techniques:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					
					Contingent upon time, area and materials accessible, weaving could be the space of a couple of specialists or an inescapable, mainstream method. This adaptability prompted an assortment of works, from the imperial to the mundane.<br> 

Intricately weaved garments, strict articles, and family unit things frequently were viewed as a sign of abundance and status, as on account of Opus Anglicanum, a procedure utilized by proficient workshops and organizations in middle age England. In eighteenth century England and its settlements, samplers utilizing fine silks were created by the little girls of well off families. Weaving was an expertise denoting a young lady's way into womanhood just as passing on position and social standing.<br> 

Alternately, weaving is additionally a people craftsmanship, utilizing materials that were open to nonprofessionals. Models incorporate Hardanger from Norway, Merezhka from Ukraine, Mountmellick weaving from Ireland, Nakshi kantha from Bangladesh and West Bengal, and Brazilian weaving. Numerous procedures had a viable utilize, for example, Sashiko from Japan, which was utilized as an approach to strengthen clothing.<br> 

While verifiably saw as a side interest, movement, or pastime, planned only for ladies, weaving has regularly been utilized as a type of history. Ladies who couldn't get to conventional schooling or, on occasion, composing actualizes, were frequently shown weaving and used it as a methods for reporting their lives. As far as recording the chronicles of minimized gatherings, particularly ladies of shading both inside the United States and around the globe, weaving is a methods for considering the consistently daily routines of those whose lives generally went unstudied all through quite a bit of history.
					
					</ul>
					<b><h9>The Islamic world:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					
					Embroidery was a significant craftsmanship in the Medieval Islamic world. The seventeenth century Turkish voyager Evliya Çelebi considered it the "art of the two hands". Since weaving was an indication of high economic wellbeing in Muslim social orders, it turned out to be generally famous. In urban areas, for example, Damascus, Cairo and Istanbul, weaving was noticeable on hankies, regalia, banners, calligraphy, shoes, robes, tunics, horse features, shoes, sheaths, pockets, covers, and even on cowhide belts. Skilled workers weaved things with gold and silver string. Weaving house enterprises, some utilizing more than 800 individuals, developed to gracefully these items.<br> 

In the sixteenth century, in the rule of the Mughal Emperor Akbar, his recorder Abu al-Fazl ibn Mubarak wrote in the celebrated Ain-I-Akbari: "His highness (Akbar) gives a lot of consideration to different stuffs; subsequently Irani, Ottoman, and Mongolian articles of wear are in much plenitude particularly materials weaved in the examples of Nakshi, Saadi, Chikhan, Ari, Zardozi, Wastli, Gota and Kohra. The magnificent workshops in the towns of Lahore, Agra, Fatehpur and Ahmedabad turn out numerous show-stoppers of workmanship in textures, and the figures and examples, bunches and assortment of designs which presently win shock even the most experienced explorers. Taste for fine material has since gotten general, and the curtain of weaved textures utilized at feasts outperforms each depiction".

					<b><h9>Automation:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					
					The improvement of machine weaving and its large scale manufacturing occurred in stages during the Industrial Revolution. The primary weaving machine was the hand weaving machine, designed in France in 1832 by Josué Heilmann. The following transformative advance was the schiffli weaving machine. The last obtained from the sewing machine and the Jacquard loom to completely mechanize its activity. The production of machine-made weavings in St. Gallen in eastern Switzerland thrived in the last 50% of the nineteenth century. Both St. Gallen, Switzerland and Plauen, Germany were significant places for machine weaving and weaving machine advancement. Numerous Swiss and Germans moved to Hudson region, New Jersey in the mid 20th century and built up a machine weaving industry there.

					Embroidery can be arranged by what degree the plan considers the idea of the base material and by the relationship of line situation to the texture. The primary classifications are free or surface weaving, tallied weaving, and needlepoint or canvas work.<br> 

In free or surface weaving, plans are applied regardless of the weave of the hidden texture. Models incorporate crewel and customary Chinese and Japanese embroidery.<br> 

Tallied string weaving designs are made by making join over a foreordained number of strings in the establishment texture. Tallied string weaving is all the more effortlessly chipped away at an even-weave establishment texture, for example, weaving canvas, aida material, or uniquely woven cotton and cloth textures. Models incorporate cross-fasten and a few types of blackwork embroidery.<br> 

While like included string with respect to strategy, in canvas work or needlepoint, strings are sewed through a texture lattice to make a thick example that totally covers the establishment texture. Instances of canvas work incorporate bargello and Berlin fleece work.<br> 

Weaving can likewise be grouped by the likeness of appearance. In drawn string work and cutwork, the establishment texture is disfigured or removed to make openings that are then decorated with weaving, regularly with string in a similar shading as the establishment texture. When made with white string on white cloth or cotton, this work is by and large alluded to as whitework. Notwithstanding, whitework can either be tallied or free. Hardanger weaving is a checked weaving and the plans are frequently mathematical. On the other hand, styles, for example, Broderie anglaise are sans like weaving, with botanical or dynamic plans that are not reliant on the weave of the texture.

Machine weaving is most regularly finished with rayon string, despite the fact that polyester string can likewise be utilized. Cotton string, then again, is inclined to breaking and should be dodged if under 30 wt.<br> 

There has likewise been an improvement in free hand machine weaving, new machines have been planned that consider the client to make free-movement weaving which has its place in material expressions, knitting, dressmaking, home decorations and that's just the beginning.
