					Banner-making is the ancient art or craft of sewing banners. Techniques used include applique, embroidery, fabric painting, patchwork and others.<br><br>
					A banner can be a flag or other piece of cloth bearing a symbol, logo, slogan or other message. A flag whose design is the same as the shield in a coat of arms (but usually in a square or rectangular shape) is called a banner of arms. Also, a bar-shaped piece of non-cloth advertising material sporting a name, slogan, or other marketing message.<br><br>

Banner-making is an ancient craft. Church banners commonly portray the saint to whom the church is dedicated.<br><br>

The word derives from Old French baniere (modern French: banni√®re), from Late Latin bandum, which was borrowed from a Germanic source (compare Gothic: êå±êå∞êåΩêå≥êçÖêå∞, romanized: bandwa). Cognates include Italian bandiera, Portuguese bandeira, and Spanish bandera.

					In the United Kingdom, the first of these flags were once in a while painted by nearby signwriters, coachpainters or decorators. As a rule, they were made by an individual from the nearby office who was viewed as masterful. In any case, from 1837 onwards, multiple quarters were made by the firm of George Tutill of Chesham in Buckinghamshire. Every one of their pennants were produced using unadulterated silk woven by Huguenots in London. At the stature of flag creation there were supposed to be 17,000 weaving machines operation.<br><br> 

The silk was extended tight over a wooden casing and covered with India elastic, and the oil colors applied to it were 'old', for example had been remaining around for some time. This permitted the paint to dry rapidly and to make it more flexible or elastic.<br><br> 

There were numerous plans from the Bible (for example David killing Goliath), from heraldry or from mainstream convention, for example the "infinitely knowledgeable eye", or images of truth, expectation or equity.

					<p>
					With the advent of Conservative governments in Britain after the 1979 general election, trades union banners lost their popularity, and many languished in damp cellars or lofts. Additionally the large number of trade union mergers (see for example UNISON and Amicus) meant that many banners no longer had the correct union name on and became obsolete. In the last 10 years or so, the interest in these banners has been rekindled, and many books, videos, postcards and the like have been produced to help people rediscover and celebrate this part of the history of working men and women.<br><br>

Durham Miners Gala is probably the largest current parade of trade union banners.<br><br>

There are special museums which restore, preserve and exhibit trade union banners, e.g. the People's History Museum in Manchester and Beamish Museum in the North East.
