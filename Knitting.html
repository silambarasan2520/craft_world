					Knitting is a method by which yarn is manipulated to create a textile or fabric; it is used in many types of garments. Knitting may be done by hand or by machine.<br>

Knitting creates stitches: loops of yarn in a row, either flat or in the round (tubular). There are usually many active stitches on the knitting needle at one time. Knitted fabric consists of a number of consecutive rows of connected loops that intermesh with the next and previous rows. As each row is formed, each newly created loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row and placed on the gaining needle so that the loops from the prior row can be pulled off the other needle without unraveling.<br>

Differences in yarn (varying in fibre type, weight, uniformity and twist), needle size, and stitch type allow for a variety of knitted fabrics with different properties, including color, texture, thickness, heat retention, water resistance, and integrity. A small sample of knitwork is known as a swatch.<br>

The specific causes of sewing are obscure, the soonest realized models being cotton socks found in Egyptian pyramids.<br><br> 

NÃ¥lebinding (Danish: in a real sense "authoritative with a needle" or "needle-official") is a texture creation strategy originating before both weaving and crochet.<br><br> 

The main business sewing societies show up in Western Europe in the mid fifteenth century (Tournai in 1429, Barcelona in 1496). The Guild of Saint Fiacre was established in Paris in 1527 however the files notice an association (not really a society) of knitters from 1268. The occupation: "cap knitter" depicts Margaret Yeo, of London, in 1473.<br><br> 

With the development of the stocking outline, an early type of weaving machine, sewing "by hand" turned into an art utilized by nation individuals with simple admittance to fiber. Like stitching, turning, and needlepoint, hand weaving turned into a recreation movement for the well off. English Roman Catholic cleric and a previous Anglican priest, Richard Rutt, composed a background marked by the art in A History of Hand Knitting (Batsford, 1987). His assortment of books about sewing is presently housed at the Winchester School of Art (University of Southampton).

					There are a large number of various sewing lines utilized by hand knitters. A bit of hand weaving starts with the way toward projecting on, which includes the underlying production of the join on the needle. Various techniques for projecting on are utilized for various impacts: one might be stretchy enough for trim, while another gives an improving edging. Temporary cast-ons are utilized when the weaving will proceed in the two ways from the cast-on. There are different strategies utilized to project on, for example, the "thumb technique" (otherwise called "slingshot" or "long-tail" cast-ons), where the join are made by a progression of circles that will, when weaved, give an extremely free edge ideal for "getting lines" and sewing an outskirt; the "twofold needle strategy" (otherwise called "sew on" or "link cast-on"), whereby each circle put on the needle is then "sewn on," which delivers a firmer edge ideal all alone as a fringe; and some more. The quantity of dynamic lines stays as before as when projected on except if lines are added (an expansion) or eliminated (a decrease).<br><br> 

Most Western-style hand knitters follow either the English style (in which the yarn is held in the correct hand) or the Continental style (wherein the yarn is held in the left hand).<br><br> 

There are additionally various approaches to embed the needle into the join. Sewing through the front of a fasten is called Western sewing. Experiencing the rear of a line is called Eastern sewing. A third strategy, called mix weaving, experiences the front of a sew line and the rear of a purl stitch.<br><br> 

When the hand sewed piece is done, the excess live fastens are "cast off". Projecting (or "official") off circles the lines over one another so they can be taken out from the needle without unwinding the thing. Despite the fact that the repairmen are unique in relation to projecting on, there is a comparable assortment of methods.<br><br> 

Close by sewing certain pieces of clothing, particularly bigger ones like sweaters, the last weaved article of clothing will be made of a few sewed pieces, with singular segments of the article of clothing hand sewed independently and afterward sewn together. Consistent sewing, where an entire article of clothing is hand weave as a solitary piece, is additionally conceivable. Elizabeth Zimmermann is most likely the most popular defender of consistent or round hand weaving methods. More modest things, for example, socks and caps, are typically sew in one piece on twofold pointed needles or round needles. Caps specifically can be begun "top down" on twofold pointed needles with the increments added until the favored size is accomplished, changing to a fitting roundabout needle when enough fastens have been added. Care should be taken to tie off at a strain that will permit the "offer" expected to easily fit on the head. (See Circular weaving).

					<b><h9>Yarn:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					Yarn for hand-weaving is generally sold as balls or skeins (hanks), and it might likewise be injury on spools or cones. Skeins and balls are commonly sold with a yarn-band, a mark that depicts the yarn's weight, length, color part, fiber content, washing guidelines, recommended needle size, likely check/pressure, and so on It is basic practice to spare the yarn band for future reference, particularly if extra skeins should be bought. Knitters by and large guarantee that the yarn for a task comes from a solitary color part. The color part determines a gathering of skeins that were colored together and consequently have decisively a similar shading; skeins from various color parcels, regardless of whether fundamentally the same as in shading, are typically somewhat unique and may create an obvious even stripe when sewn together. On the off chance that a knitter purchases inadequate yarn of a solitary color part to finish an undertaking, extra skeins of a similar color parcel can once in a while be acquired from other yarn stores or on the web. Something else, knitters can substitute skeins each couple of lines to help the color parts mix together easier.<br>

The thickness or weight of the yarn is a huge factor in deciding the check/strain, i.e., the number of fastens and columns are needed to cover a given region for a given join design. Thicker yarns by and large require thicker weaving needles, though more slender yarns might be sew with thick or meager needles. Thus, thicker yarns by and large require less fastens, and subsequently less time, to weave up a given article of clothing. Examples and themes are coarser with thicker yarns; thicker yarns produce strong special visualizations, though more slender yarns are best for refined examples. Yarns are assembled by thickness into six classes: superfine, fine, light, medium, massive and superbulky; quantitatively, thickness is estimated by the quantity of wraps per inch (WPI). In the British Commonwealth (outside North America) yarns are estimated as 1ply, 2ply, 3ply, 4ply, 5ply, 8ply (or twofold knit),10ply and 12ply (triple sew). The connected weight per unit length is normally estimated in tex or denier.<br>
					
					Before knitting, the knitter will typically transform a hank/skein into a ball where the yarn emerges from the center of the ball; this making the knitting easier by preventing the yarn from becoming easily tangled. This transformation may be done by hand, or with a device known as a ballwinder. When knitting, some knitters enclose their balls in jars to keep them clean and untangled with other yarns; the free yarn passes through a small hole in the jar-lid.<br>

A yarn's usefulness for a knitting project is judged by several factors, such as its loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and of course its look, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features. Other factors include allergenicity; speed of drying; resistance to chemicals, moths, and mildew; melting point and flammability; retention of static electricity; and the propensity to become stained and to accept dyes. Different factors may be more significant than others for different knitting projects, so there is no one "best" yarn. The resilience and propensity to (un)twist are general properties that affect the ease of hand-knitting. More resilient yarns are more forgiving of irregularities in tension; highly twisted yarns are sometimes difficult to knit, whereas untwisting yarns can lead to split stitches, in which not all the yarn is knitted into a stitch. A key factor in knitting is stitch definition, corresponding to how well complicated stitch patterns can be seen when made from a given yarn. Smooth, highly spun yarns are best for showing off stitch patterns; at the other extreme, very fuzzy yarns or eyelash yarns have poor stitch definition, and any complicated stitch pattern would be invisible.<br>
Although knitting may be done with ribbons, metal wire or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by spinning fibers. In spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in a Z-twist or S-twist yarn. If the fibers are first aligned by combing them, the yarn is smoother and called a worsted; by contrast, if the fibers are carded but not combed, the yarn is fuzzier and called woolen-spun. The fibers making up a yarn may be continuous filament fibers such as silk and many synthetics, or they may be staples (fibers of an average length, typically a few inches); naturally filament fibers are sometimes cut up into staples before spinning. The strength of the spun yarn against breaking is determined by the amount of twist, the length of the fibers and the thickness of the yarn. In general, yarns become stronger with more twist (also called worst), longer fibers and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension. The thickness of the yarn may vary along its length; a slub is a much thicker section in which a mass of fibers is incorporated into the yarn.<br>

The spun fibers are generally divided into animal fibers, plant and synthetic fibers. These fiber types are chemically different, corresponding to proteins, carbohydrates and synthetic polymers, respectively. Animal fibers include silk, but generally are long hairs of animals such as sheep (wool), goat (angora, or cashmere goat), rabbit (angora), llama, alpaca, dog, cat, camel, yak, and muskox (qiviut). Plants used for fibers include cotton, flax (for linen), bamboo, ramie, hemp, jute, nettle, raffia, yucca, coconut husk, banana fiber, soy and corn. Rayon and acetate fibers are also produced from cellulose mainly derived from trees. Common synthetic fibers include acrylics,[16] polyesters such as dacron and ingeo, nylon and other polyamides, and olefins such as polypropylene. Of these types, wool is generally favored for knitting, chiefly owing to its superior elasticity, warmth and (sometimes) felting. It is also common to blend different fibers in the yarn, e.g., 85% alpaca and 15% silk. Even within a type of fiber, there can be great variety in the length and thickness of the fibers; for example, Merino wool and Egyptian cotton are favored because they produce exceptionally long, thin (fine) fibers for their type.<br>

A single spun yarn may be knitted as is, or braided or plied with another. In plying, two or more yarns are spun together, almost always in the opposite sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two Z-twist yarns are usually plied with an S-twist. The opposing twist relieves some of the yarns' tendency to curl up and produces a thicker, balanced yarn. Plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing cabled yarns or multi-stranded yarns. Sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in bouclÃ©. The single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterwards to give the yarn a uniform look.<br>

The dyeing of yarns is a complex art that has a long history. However, yarns need not be dyed. They may be dyed just one color, or a great variety of colors. Dyeing may be done industrially, by hand or even hand-painted onto the yarn. A great variety of synthetic dyes have been developed since the synthesis of indigo dye in the mid-19th century; however, natural dyes are also possible, although they are generally less brilliant. The color-scheme of a yarn is sometimes called its colorway. Variegated yarns can produce interesting visual effects, such as diagonal stripes; conversely, a variegated yarn may obscure a detailed knitting design, such as a cable or lace pattern.

					There are multiple commercial applications for knit fabric made of metal wire by knitting machines. Steel wire of various sizes may be used for electric and magnetic shielding due to its conductivity. Stainless steel may be used in a coffee press for its rust resistance.<br>

Metal wire can also be used as jewelry.
