					Bagh print is a traditional Indian handicraft originating in Bagh, Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The process is characterised by hand printed wood block relief prints with naturally sourced pigments and dyes. Bagh print fabric motifs are typically geometric, paisley, or floral compositions dyed with vegetable colours of red and black over a white background, and is a popular textile printing product. Its name is derived from the village Bagh located on the banks of the Bagh River.

					<p>
					The birthplaces of the Bagh print are unsure, yet it is accepted that the training is more than 1,000 years of age, with the methods having been passed on through family practice from age to age. It is conceivable that the specialty went with pioneers from Jawad in the Madhya Pradesh state in India or from printers of Rajasthan state. Another chance is that the Chhipas, or conventional material printers, of the Muslim Khatri people group who presently practice the specialty of Bagh print, made a trip to the territory around 400 years back from Larkana in Sindh area, Pakistan, which is known for the Arjak custom of square printing.<br><br> 

The underlying purposes behind the relocation is muddled, however the region's vicinity to the Bagh waterway, which gave the water important to washing of texture and preparing of vegetable colors, could be the essential explanation behind getting comfortable Bagh. Furthermore, the synthetic creation of the water from the Bagh waterway improves the surface of the vegetable, common, and dark colors, giving them an iridescent quality that recognizes Bagh prints from different prints in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan regions.<br><br> 

During the 1960s, numerous expert deserted the customary cycle of Bagh prints for utilizing engineered textures. Be that as it may, various craftsmans, including Ismail Sulemanji Khatri, proceeded to rehearse and advance inside the customary system of the specialty and brought Bagh prints to worldwide prominence.<br><br> 

In 2011, a Bagh print configuration was embraced in a scene topic of the Madhya Pradesh state at the Republic Day march in New Delhi on 26 January 2011. Highlighted in the procession was a Shalbhanjika, the heavenly apsara of the eleventh century, hung in Bagh printed attire.

					<h2 class="post-title"><b><h8>Process</h8></b></h2>

					<section class="post-excerpt">
					<p>
					
					The process of creating Bagh prints includes pre-printing (the washing and pre-dying of the fabric), printing (application of the design) and post printing (fixing the dyes and applying a fabric finish).</p>
					
					<b><h9>Pre-printing:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					Pre-printing begins with Khara Karna, the underlying washing of the texture for printing. Cotton is the generally utilized texture; in any case, different textures incorporate the Maheshwari suit material, kosa silk, bamboo chicks, chiffon, crepe, georgette tissue, and mulberry silk. The Khara Karna washing comprises of washing in running water for two hours and beating the texture on waterway stones to eliminate any starch in the texture to help with the coloring process.<br><br> 

Next, the texture is absorbed a water arrangement of rock salt, mengni (goat compost), and castor oil, squeezed, flushed and dried multiple times, which is known as Mengni Karna. At that point, the fabric is pre-colored with Harara to give a grayish base tone, which likewise adds a lavishness to the dark and red colors that will be applied later.
					
					</ul>
					<b><h9>Printing:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					Bagh prints are made by hand applying natural and vegetable based dyes using carved wood relief blocks. Red and black dyes are most common, but indigo, mustard, and khaki dyes are also used. New blocks for printing are hand carved from teak or sheesham wood, but some blocks have been in use for 200 â€“ 300 years. Motifs for the prints are geometric or floral, sometimes inspired by the 1,500 year old paintings at Bagh Caves.
					</ul>
					<b><h9>Dyes:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					Colors for printing are gotten from plant sources (plants, natural products, and blossoms), and minerals. To make the colors, shades like ferrous sulfate and alum are bubbled in water and blended in with tamarind seed powder to make a glue, which goes about as dark and red colors separately. Different tones like indigo, mustard, and khaki can be made utilizing indigo leaves, dhavdi leaves, or pomegranate skins.
					
					</ul>
					<b><h9>Printing blocks:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					The blocks, known as bilals, are made of intricate and deeply carved teak or sheesham wood and are frequently sourced from Pethapur, Gandhinagar, and Jaipur.[1][6] The relief blocks can be reused and collected over generations, with some family libraries holding thousands of individual designs. Some blocks are aged up to 300 years old and have been in use for so long that they are known by particular names. New blocks are made approximately every six months to keep up with market demands, but care is taken to ensure that the new design is a variation of a traditionally accepted design. Common motifs include geometric shapes as well as natural forms like jasmine, mushroom, mango, or small dots on a field.
					</ul>
					
					<b><h9>Printing process:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					In order to apply the correct amount of dye to the printing block, a wooden reservoir, called a palea, is filled with dye. A bamboo mesh (kartali) wrapped in wool is set up to float in the reservoir, soaking up the dye and transferring the color when the printing block is rested on top. The cloth to be printed is laid over a red sandstone table, called a farsi, which is padded with extra cloth or old clothes to ensure smooth printing. The printing blocks are applied by hand, with an expert craftsman producing five yards of fabric in two to three hours, depending on the complexity of the design. Once the design is fully printed, the cloth rests for 8 to 14 days to allow the dye to fully absorb into the fabric.
					</ul>
					
					<b><h9>Post-printing:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					Once the fabric has rested, it is brought to the river and rigorously washed for 20 minutes and beaten against river stones to remove excess dye. This process, known as the Bichalna, requires both strength and care, as any smudges or stains that occur from improper washing are permanent. The fabric is then fixed and finished in the Bhatti process, where the fabric is boiled in a mixture of water, Alizarin, and Dhavda flowers. The fabric is constantly shifted and turned with long sticks as the temperature of solution is slowly increased, which aids in the proper development of the colors. The whole process takes from four to six hours. Finally, the fabric is bleached and washed three more times before the fabric is complete.

					At first, Mohammed Yusuf Khatri, Mohammed Bilal Khatri, Mohammed Kazeem Khatri and their family made customary dresses to address the issues of different rank gatherings dwelling in the ancestral locale of Bagh. Individuals of various stations and families had various dresses with explicit distinguishing proof labels of the ancestral Bhil and Bhilala people group. A portion of the Kahtris created plans to meet contemporary metropolitan intuition with regards to the later piece of 1980s; these plans covered sarees, shalwar kameez, covers for pad and tables, block printed silk saree, tusser silk, silk stoll, scarf, etc. Some the relatives made creative wooden squares and tones which were acknowledged in the public and global market because of their long life. These included art, for example, block imprinting on bamboo chik or mats, cowhide, jute, and different materials other than cloth.<br><br> 

One such practice he sought after was the old strategy of reusing the conventional squares of 200 to 300 years of age, which were examples or plans of compositions in the 1,500 year old cavern canvases in the region.<br><br> 

A portion of the square plans covered Nariyal Zaal and Ghevar Zaal dependent on the Taj Mahal canvases, Saj, Dakmandwa, chameli or jasmine, maithir or mushroom, leheriya and jurvaria or little spots on the field. Different advancements presented by the Khatri family are block plans of the jaali design from the Taj Mahal and fortresses in the district, normalizing the utilization of essential shades of alum based red, and consumed filings of iron for dark, and creating vegetable based yellow and green colors. His essential development was making the Bagh print on various kinds of fabric by imprinting on them. His inventive plan of a bed blanket, comprised of a bed blanket which had 1,200 unique squares and won him the National Award in 1984.
