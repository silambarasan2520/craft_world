					<p>
					Dyeing is the utilization of colors or shades on material materials, for example, strands, yarns, and textures with the objective of accomplishing shading with wanted shading speed. Coloring is typically done in an uncommon arrangement containing colors and specific substance material. Color atoms are fixed to the fiber by ingestion, dispersion, or holding with temperature and time being key controlling variables. The connection between color particle and fiber might be solid or powerless, contingent upon the color utilized. Coloring and printing are various applications; in printing, shading is applied to a restricted zone with wanted examples. In coloring, it is applied to the whole textile.<br><br> 

The essential wellspring of color, verifiably, has been nature, with the colors being removed from creatures or plants. Since the mid-nineteenth century, notwithstanding, people have delivered counterfeit colors to accomplish a more extensive scope of shadings and to deliver the colors more steady to washing and general use. Various classes of colors are utilized for various sorts of fiber and at various phases of the material creation measure, from free strands through yarn and fabric to finish garments.<br><br> 

Acrylic strands are colored with fundamental colors, while nylon and protein filaments, for example, fleece and silk are colored with corrosive colors, and polyester yarn is colored with scatter colors. Cotton is colored with a scope of color types, including tank colors, and present day manufactured responsive and direct colors.

					</header>
					<section class="post-excerpt">
					<p>
					
					Dyes are applied to textile goods by dyeing from dye solutions and by printing from dye pastes and the Methods that are included are direct application and yarn dyeing.
					
					
					</p>
					<b><h9>Selection of dyes:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					The selection of the appropriate dyes is significant because any given dye does not apply to every type of fiber. Furthermore, resistance to washing, rubbing, and light differs among dyes. The selection of dye depends on the objective in dyeing and affinity (to which material is to be dyed). For example, indigo dyes have a poor wash and rubbing fastness on denim (cotton), so they are used to produce washed-down effects on fabrics. In contrast, vat or reactive dyes are applied to cotton to achieve excellent washing fastness.<br><br>

					The next important criterion for selecting dyes is the assessment of hazards to human health and the environment. There are many dyes especially disperse dyes that may cause allergic reactions to some individuals and the negative impact on the environment. There are national and international standards and regulations which need to comply.
					</ul>
					<b><h9>Direct application:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					
					The term "direct dye application" stems from some dyestuff having to be either fermented as in the case of some natural dye or chemically reduced as in the case of synthetic vat and sulfur dyes before being applied. This renders the dye soluble so that it can be absorbed by the fiber since the insoluble dye has very little substantivity to the fiber. Direct dyes, a class of dyes largely for dyeing cotton, are water-soluble and can be applied directly to the fiber from an aqueous solution. Most other classes of synthetic dye, other than vat and surface dyes, are also applied in this way.<br><br>

					The term may also be applied to dyeing without the use of mordants to fix the dye once it is applied. Mordants were often required to alter the hue and intensity of natural dyes and improve color fastness. Chromium salts were until recently extensively used in dyeing wool with synthetic mordant dyes. These were used for economical high color fastness dark shades such as black and navy. Environmental concerns have now restricted their use, and they have been replaced with reactive and metal complex dyes that do not require mordant.	
					
					</ul>
					<b><h9>Yarn dyeing:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					
					There are many forms of yarn dyeing. Common forms are the package form and the hanks form. Cotton yarns are mostly dyed at package form, and acrylic or wool yarn are dyed at hank form. In the continuous filament industry, polyester or polyamide yarns are always dyed at package form, while viscose rayon yarns are partly dyed at hank form because of technology.<br><br>
					The common dyeing process of cotton yarn with reactive dyes at package form is as follows:
					
					
					<ol>
					<li>The raw yarn is wound on a spring tube to achieve a package suitable for dye penetration.</li>
					<li>These softened packages are loaded on a dyeing carrier's spindle one on another.</li>
					<li>The packages are pressed up to a desired height to achieve suitable density of packing.</li>
					<li>The carrier is loaded on the dyeing machine and the yarn is dyed.</li>
					<li>After dyeing, the packages are unloaded from the carrier into a trolley.</li>
					<li>Now the trolley is taken to hydro extractor where water is removed.</li>
					<li>The packages are hydro extracted to remove the maximum amount of water leaving the desired color into raw yarn.</li>
					<li>The packages are then dried to achieve the final dyed package.</li>
					</ol>
					</ul>

					<section class="post-excerpt">
					<p>
					The earliest dyed flax fibers have been found in a prehistoric cave in the Republic of Georgia and date back to 34,000 BC. More evidence of textile dyeing dates back to the Neolithic period at the large Neolithic settlement at Çatalhöyük in southern Anatolia, where traces of red dyes, possibly from ocher, an iron oxide pigment derived from clay, were found. In China, dyeing with plants, barks, and insects has been traced back more than 5,000 years. Early evidence of dyeing comes from Sindh province in Pakistan, where a piece of cotton dyed with a vegetable dye was recovered from the archaeological site at Mohenjo-daro (3rd millennium BCE). The dye used in this case was madder, which, along with other dyes such as indigo, was introduced to other regions through trade. Natural insect dyes such as Cochineal and kermes and plant-based dyes such as woad, indigo and madder were important elements of the economies of Asia and Europe until the discovery of man-made synthetic dyes in the mid-19th century. The first synthetic dye was William Perkin's mauveine in 1856, derived from coal tar. Alizarin, the red dye present in madder, was the first natural pigment to be duplicated synthetically in 1869, a development which led to the collapse of the market for naturally grown madder. The development of new, strongly colored synthetic dyes followed quickly, and by the 1870s commercial dyeing with natural dyestuffs was disappearing.

					</header>
					<section class="post-excerpt">
					<p>
					
					If things go wrong in the dyeing process, the dyer may be forced to remove the dye already applied by a process called "stripping" or discharging. This normally means destroying the dye with powerful reducing agents such as sodium hydrosulfite or oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite. The process often risks damaging the substrate (fiber). Where possible, it is often less risky to dye the material a darker shade, with black often being the easiest or last option.
