					Canvas work is a kind of Needlepoint, a type of included string weaving where yarn is sewed through a hardened open weave canvas. Customarily needlepoint plans totally cover the canvas. Despite the fact that needlepoint might be worked in an assortment of fastens, numerous needlepoint plans utilize just a basic tent join and depend upon shading changes in the yarn to build the example. Needlepoint is the most seasoned type of canvas work.<br><br> 

The level of detail in needlepoint relies upon the string tally of the basic cross section texture. Because of the innate absence of flexibility of needlepoint, normal uses incorporate eyeglass cases, occasion adornments, cushions, totes, upholstery, and tapestries.

When referring to handcrafted textile arts which a speaker is unable to identify, the appropriate generalized term is "needlework". The first recorded use of the term needlepoint is in 1869, as a synonym for point-lace. Mrs Beeton's Beeton's Book of Needlework (1870) does not use the term "needlework", but rather describes "every kind of stitch which is made upon canvas with wool, silk or beads" as Berlin Work (also spelled Berlinwork). Berlin Work refers to a subset of needlepoint, popular in the mid-19th Century that was stitched in brightly colored wool on needlepoint canvas from hand-colored charts.<br><br>

"Needlepoint" refers to a particular set of stitching techniques worked upon stiff openwork canvas. However, "needlepoint" is not synonymous with all types of embroidery. Because it is stitched on a fabric that is an open grid, needlepoint is not embellishing a fabric, as is the case with most other types of embroidery, but literally the making of a new fabric. It is for this reason that many needlepoint stitches must be of sturdier construction than other embroidery stitches.<br><br>

Needlepoint is often referred to as "tapestry" in the United Kingdom and sometimes as "canvas work". However, needlepoint—which is stitched on canvas mesh—differs from true tapestry—which is woven on a vertical loom. When worked on fine weave canvas in tent stitch, it is also known as "petit point". Additionally, "needlepoint lace" is also an older term for needle lace, an historic lace-making technique.

					Most commercial needlework kits recommend one of the variants of tent stitch, although Victorian cross stitch and random long stitch are also used. Authors of books of needlepoint designs sometimes use a wider range of stitches. Historically, a very wide range of stitches have been used including:

					The foundations of needlepoint return a large number of years to the antiquated Egyptians, who utilized little skewed lines to close up their canvas tents. Howard Carter, of Tutankhamen popularity, discovered some needlepoint in the cavern of a Pharaoh who had lived around 1500 BC.<br><br> 

Present day needlepoint drops from the canvas work in tent line, done on an equitably woven open ground texture that was a famous homegrown art in the sixteenth century.<br><br>

Further advancement of needlepoint was impacted in the seventeenth century by Bargello and in the nineteenth century by concealed Berlin fleece work in brilliantly hued fleece yarn. Upholstered furniture got stylish in the seventeenth century, and this provoked the improvement of a more sturdy material to fill in as an establishment for the weaved show-stoppers. In eighteenth century America, needlepoint was utilized as a preliminary expertise to prepare young ladies to sew their own garments.
