					Felt is a material that is created by tangling, consolidating and squeezing filaments together. Felt can be made of characteristic filaments, for example, fleece or creature hide, or from engineered strands, for example, oil based acrylic or acrylonitrile or wood mash based rayon. Mixed filaments are likewise normal. Felt has exceptional properties that permit it to be utilized for a wide assortment of purposes. "It is fire-retardant and self-smothering; it hoses vibration and assimilates sound; and it can hold a lot of liquid without feeling wet.

					<p>
					
					Felt from fleece is viewed as the most seasoned known material. Numerous societies have legends with regards to the sources of felt making. Sumerian legend asserts that the mystery of feltmaking was found by Urnamman of Lagash. The tale of Saint Clement and Saint Christopher relates that the men stuffed their shoes with fleece to forestall rankles while escaping from mistreatment. Toward the finish of their excursion, the development and sweat had transformed the fleece into felt socks.<br> 

Doubtlessly felt's causes can be found in focal Asia, where there is proof of feltmaking in Siberia (Altai mountains) in Northern Mongolia and all the more as of late proof going back to the main century AD in Mongolia. Siberian burial chambers (seventh to second century BC) show the expansive employments of felt in that culture, including attire, gems, inside decorations, and expound horse covers. Utilizing cautious shading use, sewing, and different strategies, these feltmakers had the option to utilize felt as an illustrative and beautifying medium on which they could portray conceptual plans and practical scenes with incredible expertise. Over the long haul these creators got known for the wonderful conceptual examples they utilized that were gotten from plant, creature, and other emblematic designs.<br> 

From Siberia and Mongolia, feltmaking spread over the regions held by the Turkic-Mongolian clans. Sheep and camel groups were fundamental to the abundance and way of life of these clans, the two of which were basic to creating the filaments required for felting. As migrants voyaging often and living on genuinely treeless fields, felt gave lodging (yurts, tents, and so on), protection, floor covers, and inside walling, just as numerous family unit necessities from bedding and covers to apparel. In migrant people groups, a region where feltmaking was especially obvious was in features for their creatures and for movement. Felt was frequently highlighted in the covers that went under saddles.<br> 

Colors gave rich shading, and hued cuts of pre-felts (semi-felted sheets that could be cut gorgeously), alongside colored yarns and strings were consolidated to make excellent plans on the fleece foundations. Felt was even used to make emblems and special necklaces with defensive capacities. In conventional social orders, the examples inserted in the felt were additionally saturated with huge strict and representative meaning.<br> 

Feltmaking is as yet polished by traveling people groups, (for example, Mongols and Turkic individuals) in Central Asia, where mats, tents and apparel are routinely made. A portion of these are conventional things, for example, the exemplary yurt (Gers), while others are intended for the traveler market, for example, enhanced shoes. In the Western world, felt is broadly utilized as a mode for articulation in both material workmanship and contemporary craftsmanship and plan, where it has essentialness as a biologically capable material and building material.<br> 

Notwithstanding Central Asian conventions of felting, Scandinavian nations have likewise upheld feltmaking, especially for dress

					<b><h9>Wet felting:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					In the wet felting measure, high temp water is applied to layers of creature hairs, while rehashed unsettling and pressure makes the strands snare together or mesh together into a solitary bit of texture. Enveloping the appropriately organized fiber by a tough, finished material, for example, a bamboo tangle or burlap, will accelerate the felting cycle. The felted material might be done by fulling.<br> 

Just particular kinds of fiber can be wet felted effectively. Most sorts of wool, for example, those taken from the alpaca or the Merino sheep, can be gotten through the wet felting measure. One may likewise utilize mohair (goat), angora (hare), or hair from rodents, for example, beavers and muskrats. These kinds of fiber are canvassed in little scopes, like the scales found on a strand of human hair. Warmth, movement, and dampness of the wool makes the scales open, while upsetting them makes them hook onto one another, making felt. There is an elective hypothesis that the filaments wind around one another during felting. Plant filaments and engineered strands won't wet felt.<br> 

To make multi-shaded plans, felters direct a two-venture measure in which they make pre-felts of specific tones—these semi-finished sheets of hued felt would then be able to be cut with a sharp execute (blade or scissors) and the particular shadings set close to one another as in creation a mosaic. The felting cycle is then continued and the edges of the texture append to one another as the felting cycle is finished. Shrdak rugs (Turkmenistan) utilize a type of this technique wherein two bits of differentiating shading are removed with a similar example, the patterns are then exchanged, fitting one into the other, which makes a pointedly characterized and beautiful designed piece. To reinforce the joints of a mosaic style felt, feltmakers frequently add a support layer of downy that is felted alongside different parts. Feltmakers can contrast in their direction to this additional layer—where some will lay it on top of the plan prior to felting and others will put the plan on top of the reinforcing layer.<br> 

The way toward felting was adjusted to the ways of life of the various societies in which it thrived. In Central Asia, it is entirely expected to lead the moving/grinding measure with the guide of a pony, jackass, or camel, which will pull the moved felt until the cycle is finished. On the other hand, a gathering of individuals in a line may roll the felt along, kicking it routinely with their feet. Further fulling can incorporate tossing or hammering and working the edges with cautious rolling.[4]:26In Turkey, a few showers had regions devoted to feltmaking, utilizing the steam and high temp water that were at that point present for washing.

					<b><h9>Development of felting as a profession:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					As felting filled in significance to a general public, in this way, as well, did the information about procedures and approaches. Novice or network felting clearly proceeded in numerous networks while felting subject matter experts and felting focuses started to create. Nonetheless, the significance of felting to network life can be found in the way that, in numerous Central Asian people group, felt creation, is coordinated by a pioneer who directs the cycle as a custom that incorporates petitions—words and activities to carry best of luck to the cycle. Effectively finishing the making of felt (surely enormous felt pieces) is purpose behind festival, devouring, and the sharing of customary stories.<br> 

In Turkey, create organizations called "ahi" appeared, and these gatherings were liable for enrolling individuals and ensuring the information on felting. In Istanbul at one time, there were 1,000 felters working in 400 workshops enlisted in this ahi.

					<b><h9>Needle felting:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					Needle felting is a technique for making felted articles without utilizing water. The exceptional needles used to make 3D figure, gems, embellishments and 2D craftsmanship have indents along the shaft of the needle that get strands and tangle them with different filaments to create felt. These scores are at times mistakenly called "thorns", yet spikes are projections (like security fencing) and would be too hard to even consider thrusting into the fleece and almost difficult to pull out. There are numerous sizes and kinds of scored needles for various utilizations while working. Needle felting is utilized in mechanical cycles just as in individual crafting.<br> 

Needles utilized for making are frequently slender needles, some of the time fitted in holders that permit the client to use at least 2 needles all at once to shape fleece articles and shapes. The single dainty needles are utilized for detail and the numerous needles that are combined together are utilized for bigger regions or to frame the base of the undertaking. Anytime an assortment of fiber tones might be added for detail and singularity, utilizing needles to fuse them into the project.<br> 

The kawaii style of needle felting was made famous by the Japanese culture. Kawaii implies adorable in Japanese and to felt in the kawaii style just intends to make the article charming. Most kawaii needle felt figures have little, negligible detail, faces and are brilliantly hued. They are more charming and lively contrasted with the more conventional needle felt which is more natural and hearty. Ikuyo Fujita（藤田育代 Fujita Ikuyo）is a Japanese craftsman who works fundamentally in needle felt painting and mogol (pipe cleaner) art.<br> 

Needle felting can likewise be utilized to make practical 3 dimensional creatures. A wire armature can be made to help the cycle and offer help, around which a needle felted body and coat can be added. The craft of needle felting is turning out to be famous worldwide.<br> 

All the more as of late, needle-felting or frivolity machines have gotten famous for workmanship or specialty felters. Like a sewing machine, these devices have a few needles that punch strands together as the client pushes filaments through in a way fundamentally the same as taking care of a sewing machine. The frivolity machine permits the client to make remarkable mixes of filaments and plans.

					<ul>
					
					Designed during the seventeenth century and utilized until the mid-twentieth hundreds of years, a cycle called "carroting" was utilized in the production of good quality felt for making men's caps. Beaver, bunny or rabbit skins were treated with a weaken arrangement of the mercury compound mercuric nitrate. The skins were dried in a stove where the dainty hide along the edges turned orange, the shade of carrots. Pelts were extended over a bar in a cutting machine, and the skin was cut off in slight shreds, with the wool leaving endlessly totally. The hide was blown onto a cone-formed colander and afterward treated with heated water to merge it. The cone at that point stripped off and went through wet rollers to make the hide felt. These 'hoods' were then colored and hindered to make caps. The poisonous arrangements from the carrot and the fumes it delivered brought about boundless instances of mercury harming among hatters. This might be the birthplace of the expression "distraught as a hatter" which was utilized to entertaining impact by Lewis Carroll in the section "A Mad Tea Party" of the novel Alice in Wonderland.
