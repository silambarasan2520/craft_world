					Lace is a delicate fabric made of yarn or thread in an open weblike pattern, made by machine or by hand.<br><br>

Originally linen, silk, gold, or silver threads were used. Now lace is often made with cotton thread, although linen and silk threads are still available. Manufactured lace may be made of synthetic fiber. A few modern artists make lace with a fine copper or silver wire instead of thread.

					</ul>
					<b><h9>Chemical lace:</h9></b>
					<ul>
						Chemical lace: the stitching area is stitched with embroidery threads that form a continuous motif. Afterwards, the stitching areas are removed and only the embroidery remains. The stitching ground is made of a water-soluble or non-heat-resistant material
					</ul>
					<b><h9>Crocheted lace:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					Crocheted lace includes Irish crochet, pineapple crochet, and filet crochet.
					</ul>
					<b><h9>Cutwork:</h9></b>
					<ul>

					</ul>
					<b><h9>Knitted lace:</h9></b>
					<ul>

					</ul>
					<b><h9>Knotted lace:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					Knotted lace includes macram√© and tatting. Tatted lace is made with a shuttle or a tatting needle.
					</ul>
					<b><h9>Machine-made:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					Machine-made lace is any style of lace created or replicated using mechanical means.
					</ul>
					<b><h9>Needle lace:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					Needle lace, such as Venetian Gros Point, is made using a needle and thread. This is the most flexible of the lace-making arts. While some types can be made more quickly than the finest of bobbin laces, others are very time-consuming. Some purists regard needle lace as the height of lace-making. The finest antique needle laces were made from a very fine thread that is not manufactured today.
					</ul>
					<b><h9>Tape lace:</h9></b>
					<ul>
					Tape lace makes the tape in the lace as it is worked, or uses a machine- or hand-made textile strip formed into a design, then joined and embellished with needle or bobbin lace.

					The starting point of ribbon is contested by antiquarians. An Italian case is a will of 1493 by the Milanese Sforza family. A Flemish case is trim on the alb of a loving cleric in an artistic creation around 1485 by Hans Memling. But since ribbon developed from different procedures, it is difficult to state that it began in any one place.<br><br> 

The late sixteenth century denoted the fast improvement of trim, both needle ribbon and bobbin trim got prevailing in both style just as home stylistic layout. For improving the magnificence of collars and sleeves, needle trim was weaved with circles and picots.<br><br> 

Trim was utilized by pastorate of the early Catholic Church as a component of garbs in strict functions however didn't come into far and wide use until the sixteenth century in the northwestern piece of the European mainland. The fame of ribbon expanded quickly and the house business of trim creation spread all through Europe. In 1840, Britain's Queen Victoria was hitched in ribbon, affecting the wedding dress style as of not long ago. In North America in the nineteenth century, ministers spread the information on trim creation to the Native American clans. St. John Francis Regis guided numerous ladies out of prostitution by setting up them in the trim creation and weaving exchange, which is the reason he turned into the Patron Saint of ribbon making.<br><br> 

The English diarist Samuel Pepys regularly expounded on the ribbon utilized for his, his wife's, and his colleagues' apparel, and on 10 May 1669, noticed that he expected to eliminate the gold trim from the sleeves of his jacket "as it is fit should", potentially to evade charges of garish living.<br><br> 

Catherine of Aragon while banished in Ampthill, England, was said to have upheld the trim creators there by consuming all her ribbon, and charging new pieces. This might be the source of the lacemaker's vacation - Cattern's day.
